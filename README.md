# Agricultural Yield, Price Forecasting, and Crop Disease Detection System

## Introduction
Agriculture is integral to India's economy, engaging approximately 45% of the workforce and contributing significantly to the GDP. However, the agricultural sector is vulnerable due to volatile weather conditions, market price fluctuations, and crop diseases, leading to significant financial losses annually. Our project addresses these critical issues through advanced technology, empowering farmers with reliable, data-driven solutions for improved decision-making, profitability, and resilience.

## Problem Statement
Farmers lack reliable tools to predict crop yields and market prices amid increasing weather volatility and market fluctuations. Additionally, frequent crop diseases and pest infestations cause severe economic losses. A robust, data-driven prediction and detection system is essential to enable informed decisions, stabilize farmers' incomes, and enhance agricultural resilience.

## Project Overview
Our comprehensive solution includes:
- **Crop Yield Prediction**: Utilizing statistical forecasting techniques to guide farmers on planting decisions.
- **Market Price Forecasting**: Assisting farmers in identifying optimal times to sell their produce.
- **Crop Disease Detection**: Early detection and diagnosis of crop diseases through advanced machine learning.
- **Multilingual Chatbot**: Providing farmers with easy access to agricultural knowledge in their native languages.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Delivering precise answers to agricultural queries through a curated and regularly updated database.

## Tech Stack
### Data Handling and Processing
- **Dataset Storage & Management**: CSV, Pandas DataFrames
- **Data Preprocessing**: Pandas, NumPy (data cleaning, transformation, feature engineering)

### Forecasting Models
- **Time-Series Forecasting**:
  - Traditional Model: SARIMAX
  - Deep Learning Models: CNN-ResNet, Transformer-based models (TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch)

### Model Deployment & API Development
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI

### Visualization & Frontend
- **Dashboard & User Interface**: React

## Solution Components
### Agricultural Yield and Price Forecasting
Implemented using the SARIMAX model, our system predicts crop yields and market prices by capturing seasonal trends and external factors like weather conditions. Each crop-state combination is treated as a unique time-series dataset. We ensure data stationarity through differencing and ADF tests, achieving model accuracies with R-square values between 0.5 to 0.6.

### Dynamic Price Scraping and Caching
Due to the absence of market price data in the original dataset, we dynamically scrape historical market prices from official government sources, enriching our dataset. This scraped data is cached effectively, ensuring faster future access and efficient system performance.

### Crop Disease Detection
Our system combines CNN-based ResNet architecture for image feature extraction from the PlantVillage dataset, achieving an accuracy of 83%. It integrates these visual features with Gemini LLM's transformer-based models to perform comprehensive disease classification across 38 disease categories.

### Multilingual Agricultural Chatbot
Leveraging GPT-4.0, our chatbot is fine-tuned using specialized data harvested through targeted web crawling from authoritative agricultural websites. It provides accurate, localized, multilingual agricultural information, addressing queries in various native languages, including Kannada, to overcome linguistic and literacy barriers.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Our RAG system employs Pinecone DB to store embeddings generated by the "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" model, effectively responding to agricultural queries using similarity searches. Queries are augmented with retrieved context to generate precise, knowledge-driven answers via GROQ, enhancing accuracy and reliability.

## Future Scope
- **Mobile Application Development**: For convenient real-time crop health monitoring and alert systems.
- **Enhanced Market Guidance**: Real-time advisory services on market trends and optimal selling strategies.
- **Continuous Knowledge Base Expansion**: Regular updates of the RAG-powered system to integrate latest agricultural technologies and practices.
